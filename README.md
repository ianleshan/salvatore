THerefore, if the narrator becomes Salvatore during the game, they can use this information to weed out anyone who's lying. While if the narrator becomes Deadly Nightshade, they can lie abou their role more accurately because they can pick a role that they did not include in the roster. The narrator's identity is publicly known to everyone.
